     This work emerged from survival,
     prayer, and pattern recognition."
     # QUANTUM CHROMATIC PHILOSOPHY
## Created by Sharrieff Dwayne Carter (Effy Zarter)
### Newark, NJ | Baxter Terrace Projects | 2026

---

What started as a scribble on white paper became
a unified theory connecting quantum mechanics,
color theory, consciousness, and artificial intelligence.

Created by a man from the Newark projects
who survived a drive-by shooting,
earned his GED in prison,
and discovered quantum physics
through pure intuition and prayer.
